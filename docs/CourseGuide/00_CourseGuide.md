# Course Guide Overview

The **Course Guide** introduces the structure, workflow, and documentation model
used throughout the C++ Course Template. It explains how students and instructors
interact with the repository and provides a unified entry point to all topics.

This guide is organized into the following sections:

- \ref CG_RepositorySetup       "Repository Setup"
- \ref CG_DirectoryStructure    "Directory Structure"
- \ref CG_LocalWorkflow         "Local Workflow"
- \ref CG_GitHubWorkflow        "GitHub Workflow"
- \ref CG_CMakeIntegration      "CMake Integration"
- \ref CG_UnitTesting           "Unit Testing"
- \ref CG_CoverageTesting       "Coverage and Reports"
- \ref CG_Doxygen               "Documentation Generation"
